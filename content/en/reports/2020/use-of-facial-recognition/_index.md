## Executive Summary
This table summarizes the findings of a [recent investigation](/reports/2020/use-of-facial-recognition/) conducted by the Citizens Privacy Coalition of Santa Clara County. It shows the facial recognition's extent of use in by nearly every law enforcement agency in the county. Notice that currently no entities are confirmed to be currently using facial recognition, but the technology is yet to be banned anywhere, and a couple cities have expressed interest in the surveillance tactic. 

As can be seen, no law enforcement agency in the County claims to currently be employing the use of facial recognition surveillance. However, several have either tested it's use or employed it previously, namely the [Sheriff's Department](santa-clara-county), [San Jos√©](san-jose), and [Mountain View](mountain-view).
