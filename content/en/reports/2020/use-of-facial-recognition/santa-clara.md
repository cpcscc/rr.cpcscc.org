## Summary
{{< facial-recognition/individual-table santa-clara >}}

## Details
According to responses to two separate California Public Records Act requests submitted by the CPC, the Santa Clara Police Department claims to have never employed, tested, nor sought to employ or test facial recognition surveillance technology. The city's response to our request for all previous uses of the technology comes across as if they understood it to ask for all current uses. the CPC called the city directly to clarify and was assured that the technology had never been used by the Police Department.
