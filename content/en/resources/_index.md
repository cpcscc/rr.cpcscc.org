Welcome to the home of all reports and investigations written and conducted by the [Citizens Privacy Coalition of Santa Clara County](https://www.cpcscc.org/). Below you will find all reports summarizing and detailing all investigations conducted by the CPC. We focus on researching the effects of surveillance on lives of our County's citizens, especially those from marginalized populations.
