Below you are links to our workshop cirriculum. It is largely based off the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org/)'s [Surveillance Self Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/). We hold these workshops periodically and they are updated nearly every time. The links to materials and recordings will also be updated. The purpose of these pages is to give you the ability to follow along to a workshop on your own time as if you were there.
